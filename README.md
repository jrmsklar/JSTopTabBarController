JSTopTabBarController
=========

JSTopTabBarController is a new way to navigate around your iOS application. It provides a complete class that can be used very similarly to the UITabBarController class. See the demo for instructions on how to use it.

You may provide as many different tabs as you'd like, and the JSTopTabBarController class sizes and scales them proportionally. Each tab also has the option to be given a badge number, as you may simulate any type of notification with any of the tabs.
